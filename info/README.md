## Description
Drosophilia was made in 48 hours at the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) 2014 (plus a few more hours of polishing) withÂ [Gordon Calleja](http://www.twitter.com/gordoncalleja) and [Sidsel Hermansen](http://www.twitter.com/sslhrmnsn). It was written in [Twine](http://twinery.org/). Sound effects were recorded by Sidsel with a Zoom H4 and music and effects were made in Logic. Background videos were recorded with cellphones and processed in After Effects and iMovie. Some background videos are of actual oil paintings by Gordon.

## Response
Drosophilia was in the exhibition [Fear of Twine](http://www.fearoftwine.com/) with a number of other very interesting Twine games. It has been covered by [PC Gamer&#8217;s Best Free Games of the Week](http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/02/22/the-best-free-games-of-the-week-14/) and [Emily Short](http://emshort.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/fear-of-twine-continued/#more-6227).
